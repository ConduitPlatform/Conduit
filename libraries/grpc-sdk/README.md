# Conduit SDK module
This module provides a framework to bind all conduit modules in a safe way. 
It is also used to register and replace modules. In future this can be used
to entirely replace the routing provider for example or the cms with another
implementation.

## Features [WIP]
- Defines an Interface for all modular functionalities of Conduit
- Provides constructors for model declaration in Conduit

### TODO
- EVERYTHING
