# Router Module

This module utilizes [Hermes](../../libraries/hermes) so as to expose application-level APIs and
provide a way for Conduit modules to register application routes.

## Features ‚úîÔ∏è

- REST (with Swagger)
- GraphQL
- WebSockets (via Socket.io)

## Requirements ‚ö°

- [Database](../database) module

## Environment Variables üìÉ <a name="env-vars"></a>

|       Variable       | Description                                          | Required |      Example       |
|:--------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------| :------: |:------------------:|
|   `CONDUIT_SERVER`   | Conduit Core's address and port                      |   True   |  `0.0.0.0:55152`   |
|     `SERVICE_IP`     | This should be where this service listens on. If behind a LB it should point to the LB's IP/DNS  |   False   |  `0.0.0.0:55190`   |
|     `GRPC_PORT`      | The port number the gRPC server will listen to                      |  False   |  `55190`           |
|     `GRPC_KEY`       | Specifying a secret enables gRPC signed request protection (**use across modules**) |   False  | `someRandomSecret` |
|  `CLIENT_HTTP_PORT`  | Port to be used by application REST and GrahpQL APIs |  False   |  `3000` |
| `CLIENT_SOCKET_PORT` | DPort to be used by application WebSockets API       |  False   |  `3001` |

## Usage

The router, as all modules in Conduit, communicates through the [gRPC-sdk](../../libraries/grpc-sdk).

For every route that you declare you have the following parameters:

- input: ConduitRouteOptions,
- type: ConduitRouteReturnDefinition,
- handler: (request: ConduitRouteParameters) => Promise

Let's break them down to see what they do

### Input

These options specify the parameters that Conduit should extract
from the requests of the clients. Each field represents a different
position in the request. It mainly effects REST requests, since GraphQL
only has one type of parameter. Parameters default to optional if the required
field is missing.

- queryParams?: ConduitRouteOption;
- bodyParams?: ConduitModel;
- urlParams?: ConduitRouteOption;

Actions are GET, PUT, POST, DELETE. While these verbs are more obvious in REST,
on GraphQL they are used to distinct between queries(GET) and mutations(the rest). Also,
they are used to provide more descriptive naming when query names are not provided by the user
or if the endpoints are auto-generated like in the case of the CMS.

- action:ConduitRouteActions;

The path field is used for REST urls and for the auto-generated names of GraphQL.

- path: string;

The name for the route is optional and only used in GraphQL currently. If you
do not wish for conduit to generate the GraphQL names then you can specify your name here.
- name?: string;

Description isn't currently used, but will be added in Swagger and GraphQL to provide more info on the specific route
- description?: string;

Middlewares specify each middleware that should be run before the actual handler that you provide.
The middlewares array should contain names of handlers that conduit knows about.
In the future this may also include external urls.
- middlewares?: string[];

The cacheControl field works almost the same as the relevant HTTP header.
It expects either public,max-age=number or private,max-age=number or nothing.
If you sent any other string that those provided conduit will not utilize caching for the request.
The number that you specify also sets the expiry time of conduit's cache. All caching takes place,
AFTER middleware execution
- cacheControl?: string;
