# Conduit Platform

Conduit is a self-hosted backend aiming to cut down development times by providing common functionality through ready-made modules, while offering maximum flexibility through extensions and custom modules.

Why write and debug the same boilerplate code for every project when you can focus on implementing the features that genuinely matter for your unique application.

Conduit takes care of all the tedious tasks that come with developing a backend from scratch, allowing you to spend your time building APIs that are going to properly support your project's needs and make it stand out.

Built with Node.js (TypeScript) + gRPC, works with any stack.

# Getting Started ‚ú®

We built a CLI to help you conveniently spin up local Conduit deployments among other interesting things.

It's available through multiple installation options. Here's an example using `npm`:

``` bash
# Option A: Just give me a barebones setup of the latest Conduit release
npx @conduitplatform/cli deploy setup

# Option B: I wish to bring up extra modules and perform some basic configuration
npx @conduitplatform/cli deploy setup --config
```

# Contributing ‚ù§Ô∏è

We built Conduit cause we felt like none of the already available options seemed right for our needs.

Then we made it open-source so that everyone can use and extend it however they see fit.

If you enjoy building awesome things and want to support the project, check out our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/ConduitPlatform/Conduit/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to find out how to get started.
